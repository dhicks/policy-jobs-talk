## My postdoc Odyssey

- Born in Bay Area, grew up in Sierra Nevada foothills
- PhD in 2012
- Various postdocs from 2012-2015
- ~150-200 tenure-track job applications
- All unsuccessful
- Philosophy's ivory tower culture
    - The more abstract the better
    - Any philosophy that's useful is "merely applied"
    - Other disciplines are inferior to philosophy

## My postdoc Odyssey

- 2015-17: **AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellowship**
- 2017: Whoops, Trump, finding a policy job is impossible
- 2017: Back to California for yet another postdoc
    - Expected to end up in staff position at UC Davis, 
      in state government, or the tech industry
- 2019: Miraculous TT job offer from UC Merced
