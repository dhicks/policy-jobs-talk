Science, but without the evil
==========
- PhD 2012 in philosophy of science
    - Also a lot of history and sociology of science, <br/>
    gender studies
- Science can be incredibly beneficial for human well-being
- But often has been actively harmful: 
    - race science and eugenics
    - naturalizing sexism and cissexism
    - weapons of mass destruction
    - propaganda and psychological torture
    - fossil fuels and other pollution
- Environmental justice movements as exemplar for **democratizing science and policy** (Fernández Pinto and Hicks 2019: [10.1289/EHP3317](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP3317))

**Making science better requires engaging with scientists, publics, policymakers**


My postdoc Odyssey
==========
- Born in Bay Area; <br/>
grew up in Sierras east of Sacramento
- PhD in 2012
- Various postdocs from 2012-2015
- ~150 tenure-track job applications
- All unsuccessful
- Philosophy's ivory tower culture
    - The more abstract the better
    - Any philosophy that's useful is "merely applied"
    - Other disciplines are inferior to philosophy
